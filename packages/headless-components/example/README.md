# Headless Components in use with Next.js, WPGraphQL, Apollo, and WordPress

This example demonstrates headless components in a headless WordPress site powered by Next.js.

## Setup

1. Install and activate the [WPGraphQL plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) on your WordPress site.
2. Install and activate the wpe-headless plugin from the wpengine/headless-framework repository.
3. In the WordPress admin area, add menu items to your Primary and Footer menu locations at Appearance â†’ Menus.
4. Replace `http://dev.test` in `packages/headless-components/example/.env.local` with the path to your WordPress installation.
5. `cd packages/headless-components && npm install && npm run build`
6. `cd packages/headless-components/example && npm install && npm run dev`
7. Visit the Next.js site at http://localhost:3000.

You will see menu items from the 'primary' menu location in the header, and menu items from the 'footer' menu location in the footer.

## WPMenu

Find the WPMenu component in use at `packages/headless-components/example/pages/index.js`. Menu data is loaded server-side in `getStaticProps()`:

```js
  await apolloClient.query({ query: WP_MENU_QUERY })
```

By default, the menu loads items from the 'primary' WordPress menu location.

```js
<WPMenu />
```

Pass an alternative location with the `location` prop:

```js
<WPMenu location='footer' />
```

Default styling is imported in `packages/headless-components/example/pages/_app.js`.
